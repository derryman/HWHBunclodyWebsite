      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div class="one-club-intro">
        <p>In our club we are committed to the OneClub initiative and hope to integrate all our clubs under one banner in the coming years. See SGI statement below</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SGI Statement -->
      <div class="sgi-statement">
        <h2>Steering Group on Integration (SGI) Statement</h2>
        
        <p>After a long and intensive process of listening and engagement with all constituents, who's goodwill and enthusiasm we have been encouraged by, the Steering Group on Integration (SGI) are pleased to share more details on the core principles that have been agreed as part of the ongoing work towards Integration for all Gaelic games. The exemplary work being carried out by the various working groups is continuing to lead us forward with this process.</p>

        <p>These principles will form part of the final proposals, which will be presented to the three Associations in due course. It must be clearly understood that these proposals are provisional in nature and will not be considered final or binding until they have been formally debated and approved by all three national congresses.</p>

        <p>No definitive outcome can be assumed prior to that point. The authority to determine the final position rests exclusively with the democratic decision-making processes of the Associations, in which the participation of members remains fundamental.</p>

        <h3>Core Principles Agreed by the Steering Group on Integration:</h3>
        
        <ol class="core-principles">
          <li><strong>Integration Timeline</strong> - We are continuing to work towards the timeline as previously communicated.</li>
          <li><strong>Single Association</strong> - Post integration, there will be one Association, called the GAA.</li>
          <li><strong>Unified Membership</strong> - A single membership structure will apply to all members after integration.</li>
          <li><strong>Structures</strong> - The basic structures of Club, County, Province and National will remain consistent with the existing models.</li>
          <li><strong>Officer Roles</strong> - Current officer roles at each unit will largely remain, including core roles (e.g., Secretary, Treasurer, Children's Officer). Some additional roles will be introduced to ensure all codes played in a unit are equally represented on the Management Committee/Executive. Bye-laws will continue to be permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Rules and Governance</strong> - The Treoir Oifigiúil (Official Guide), along with existing Rules and Codes, will remain largely consistent with current GAA documents. Amendments will be introduced as necessary to support the effective operation of the new integrated Association and to ensure appropriate and effective representation of the Camogie Association and the Ladies Gaelic Football Association within the rules.</li>
          <li><strong>New Club Constitution</strong> - A new GAA club constitution will be introduced to reflect the expanded range of playing codes in the new association.</li>
          <li><strong>Clubs</strong> - Following integration, all clubs will be formally affiliated with the new GAA. In certain instances, this may result in duplication, such as where separate Camogie, GAA or Ladies Football clubs currently exist within the same area. Decisions regarding potential mergers or amalgamations will remain at the discretion of the local units, with both the approach and timing to be determined locally.</li>
          <li><strong>Competitions</strong> - Competitions at all levels will continue across the four codes, with enhanced coordination and integration.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We believe these principles provide a clear framework for a unified future while respecting the traditions, structures, and autonomy of our clubs and members.</p>

        <p>We will continue to keep you informed as the process develops and look forward to engaging with you further as we move towards presenting the final proposals for your consideration.</p>

        <blockquote class="sgi-quote">
          <p>"If we are to remain true to our core objective of providing playing opportunities for all members of our communities, we must recognise that the full flourishing of Gaelic games is intrinsically linked to the adequacy and accessibility of our facilities. The future of our games will require full inclusivity, ensuring equal access for all participants. Inevitably, this will necessitate a strategic call on funding in due course, so that we can continue to honour our commitment to the Gaelic games family in every community."</p>
          <cite>Mary McAleese, Chairperson of Steering Group on Integration, September 2025</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="sgi-signature">This statement is issued jointly by the Steering Group on Integration, which is made up of the three association Uachtaráin (Brian Molloy - Camogie Association, Jarlath Burns - Gaelic Athletic Association and Trina Murray - Ladies Gaelic Football Association), the three Ard Stiúrthóirí (Sinéad McNulty – Camogie Association, Tom Ryan – Gaelic Athletic Association and Helen O' Rourke – Ladies Gaelic Football Association), Mary McAleese as Chairperson.</p>
